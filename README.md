# 💫About Me :
I am currently studying at Celal Bayar University and my majors include business administration. During the covid pandemic shutdown in 2020, I became interested in cybersecurity and discovered the field of cybersecurity, which is new for both myself and me. As of 2021, I started to develop myself in the field of cyber security, and the sector I was interested in as a hobby had become a profession for me. I am trying to take advantage of all the opportunities that come my way right now and I continue to move steadily on this path that I want to move forward.
